# Dummy Dataset – Online Retail II (Enhanced Version)

This dummy dataset is a simulated, cleaned, and feature-enhanced version of the original **Online Retail II** dataset. It is designed for data analysis, machine learning, and dashboard-building use cases. The dataset includes both real and dummy columns such as `p_name`, `Quantity`, and `Vendor` for better modeling and learning.

##  Dataset Overview

- **Source**: Based on the UCI Online Retail II dataset
- **Type**: Dummy-enhanced transactional data
- **Purpose**: Simulated for analytics, visualization, and machine learning practice

##  Column-by-Column Explanation

### 1. `StockCode`
- Unique product/item code.
- Mostly numeric (`85048`), but may include capital letters (`85048A`, `POST`).
- **Capital letters** indicate:
  - Product variants (e.g., color, size)
  - Special services (e.g., `POST` = postage)
  - Metadata or adjustment entries

### 2. `p_name`
- Extracted and simplified version of the `Description`.
- Makes product names more readable and usable for analysis or grouping.
- Created using basic text processing (e.g., first 3–4 words).

### 3. `Description`
- Original product description.
- Usually in uppercase (due to warehouse system standards).
- May include product type, color, pack size, etc.

### 4. `Price`
- Unit price of each product (in GBP).
- Float values like `2.55`, `0.85`, `1.65`.
- Used to compute revenue or for pricing comparison.

### 5. `Quantity` *(Dummy)*
- Simulated quantity of items sold (random integers).
- Used to calculate total line revenue (`Price × Quantity`).
- Helps simulate order volumes and purchasing behavior.

### 6. `Vendor` *(Dummy)*
- Simulated vendor or supplier name.
- Helps simulate supplier-level analytics.
- Sample vendors: `Apple Inc.`, `Samsung Ltd.`, `Sony Corp.`, etc.

##  Hidden Patterns & Business Insights

| Insight               | Logic                                                              |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Product Variants       | `StockCode` like `85048A` vs `85048B` = different versions         |
| High-Value Products    | Filter by `Price`                                                  |
| High-Selling Products  | Filter by `Quantity`                                               |
| Supplier Performance   | Group by `Vendor` and analyze total quantity or revenue            |
| Product Grouping       | Use `p_name` to cluster and group similar items                    |

##  Use Case Ideas

-  Sales & revenue forecasting
-  ML model training with classification or regression
-  Dashboard creation (Power BI, Tableau, Streamlit)
-  Product clustering or text-based analytics
-  Recommendation system prototype (using `p_name` & `Vendor`)

## Sample Calculation

```python
df['Revenue'] = df['Price'] * df['Quantity']
